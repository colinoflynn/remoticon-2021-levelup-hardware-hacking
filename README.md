# Hardware Hacking Resources

This repo holds some of the examples used in Colin's Hardware Hacking talk at [Remoticon 2021](https://remoticon.io/).

You can see the very sketchy glitcher in the [dangerous-emfi](dangerous-emfi) folder.

You can see the code used on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ in the [rpi-glitching](rpi-glitching) folder.

Some specific resources used in the talk:

* [ChipWhisperer Jupyter Examples](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter)
* [Hardware Hacking Handbook](https://www.nostarch.com/hardwarehacking)
* [Colin's ECU Bootloader Work](https://colinoflynn.com/2020/11/bam-bam-on-reliability-of-emfi-for-in-situ-automotive-ecu-attacks/)
* [Thomas Roth R-Pi Pico](https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1460330740881702912) [NOTE - this link will be updated with a video once available]

Other examples that might be pulled up ad-hoc will be added to this list later.
